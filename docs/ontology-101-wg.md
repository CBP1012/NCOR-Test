<p>The New Ontologist Working Group is a space for those new to applied ontology to learn the basics of building models and putting ontologies to work in the world. The group is an open forum for discussion of practical modeling challenges, design patterns, technical problems, and experimentation with new ideas. The group meets once a week and is run by Cameron More, an Ontologist at CUBRC.</p>
