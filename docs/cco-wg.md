# NCOR Common Core Ontologies Working Group

## Common Core Ontologies
CCO was developed and promoted by [Ron Rudnicki](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=JLM7L2EAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and is comprised 11 ontologies extending from Basic Formal Ontology that aim to represent and integrate taxonomies of generic classes and relations across all domains. 

## NCOR CCO WG
The aim of the NCOR Common Core Ontologies Working Group (CCOWG) is to cultivate understanding of, provide contributions to, and promote developemnt of the Common Ontology (CCO) suite. The group is comprised of academics, students, and professionals with a common interest in CCO-based domain ontology engineering. 

The CCOWG is chaired by [Carter Benson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carterbeaubenson/) and hold weekly hybrid meetings. Meetings regularly involve discussion of CCO-based projects, such as design pattern refinement, alignment with nearby open-source ontologies, and crafting criteria for what counts as a "mid-level" ontology or ontology suite. Please see the minutes from past meetings below for a better understanding of topics covered. 

If you would like to attend CCOWG meetings either in-person or remotely, contact Carter at: carterbe[at]buffalo.edu.
