<h1>Resource Description Framework</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/">Resource Description Framework</a> (RDF) is a 
<span class="tooltip">data model<span class="tooltiptext">Abstract syntax providing structure to data and how it relates to the world.</span></span> 
which - at its core - requires data be formatted as triples - subject, predicate, object, each of which is a <span class="tooltip"><b>resource</b><span class="tooltiptext">Anything that can be assigned an identifier, e.g. physical entities, information, numbers, etc.</span></span>. 

Resources are assigned identifiers, such as [Uniform Resource Identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) (URIs) or [Internationalized Resource Identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_Resource_Identifier) (IRIs). URIs and IRIs share much in common with Uniform Resource Locators (URLS), which are designed to facilitate retrieval of information from a web location through a transfer protocol, the way your browser retrieves a web page through such protocols. Identifiers need not always refer to retrievable resources, however, which motivated the development of URIs and IRIs. 

URIs provide standards for naming across the web. For example, the following invoke widely used URI Schemes:  
```
https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml
```
```
mailto:ncor@gmail.com
```
The former starting with the URI scheme for hypertext transfer protocol secure and the second preceded by the scheme for email clients. Incidentally, for the curious, the link in the first example is to the official URI scheme registry. 

Principally, URIs must be globally unique and should refer to the same thing throughout their existence.
