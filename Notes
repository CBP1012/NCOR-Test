Add more on AI  -- in connection with Knowledge Graphs, but also in connection with things like this (from Hoendorf):

"For learning with smaller training sets -- either with unsupervised foundational dNNs that can be conditioned in transfer learning tasks with classical supervised dNNs -- ontologies can be used to provide annotation schemes for annotators. These schemes have an ontological foundation that allows the annotators to supply homogenous and correct outputs for a given input."

More generally, ontologically regimented data helps you avoid some of the problems faced when one is looking for sample data for ML

Make more of ISO 21838
Part 1 documents the strategy to foster interoperability across wide spectrum knowledge sources

You should introduce some less technical scenarios eg how to convince Management of the need for / benefits from ontologies

<h1>Resource Description Framework</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/">Resource Description Framework</a> (RDF) is a 
<span class="tooltip"><b>data model</b><span class="tooltiptext">Abstract syntax providing structure to data and how it relates to the world.</span></span> 
which - at its core - requires data be formatted as triples - subject, predicate, object, each of which is a <span class="tooltip"><b>resource</b><span class="tooltiptext">Anything that can be assigned an identifier, e.g., physical entities, information, numbers, etc.</span></span>. 

Resources are assigned identifiers, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">Uniform Resource Identifiers</a> (URIs) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_Resource_Identifier">Internationalized Resource Identifiers</a> (IRIs). URIs and IRIs share much in common with Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), which are designed to facilitate retrieval of information from a web location through a transfer protocol, the way your browser retrieves a web page through such protocols. Identifiers need not always refer to retrievable resources, however, which motivated the development of URIs and IRIs. 

URIs provide standards for naming across the web. For example, the following invoke widely used URI Schemes:  
<pre>https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml</pre>
<pre>mailto:ncor@gmail.com</pre>
The former starting with the URI scheme for hypertext transfer protocol secure and the second preceded by the scheme for email clients. Incidentally, for the curious, the link in the first example is to the official URI scheme registry. 

Principally, URIs must be globally unique and should refer to the same thing throughout their existence.
